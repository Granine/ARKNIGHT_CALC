# Arknights Resource Calculator
A range of features that calculates resource efficiency in the mobile game Arknight.
### What I want to say 
This is a personal project I made to practice C after around 5 month of learning so don't expect too much from this project interms of style or efficientcy.
The main reason for this project is that I cannot find a tool online that give me the net sanity reward for a stage so I decided me make one myself.
##How To Use
Open any C++ IDE with a interactable terminal (suggested: Visual studio)
Copy and paste or import the code
Follow the instruction in the terminal
Your history (if you choose to save it) will be avaliable in SanityCalcHistory.txt under the same project idrectory
